  Improve TT rendering
  Refactor messages to set in one place and make translations easier
  Unique support for non-top-level fields?
  Improve example of Repeatable form (BookDB, User) to do adds & deletes with js
  Create more usable 'add_field' routine that will handle ordering, parent,
      and form attributes. Use in create_instance.
  investigate a Catalyst View to provide better template support (like Reaction)
